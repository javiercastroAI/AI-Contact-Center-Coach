       "**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n",
       "- Greeting Section: The agent's greeting was familiar but didn't adhere to the script. The agent could consider using: \"Hello, thank you for calling ConnectPlus. My name is [agent name]. How may I assist you today? Good morning, and welcome to ConnectPlus support...\"\n",
       "- Issue Identification Section: The agent should thoroughly understand the customer's problem by asking more detailed questions. For example, \"Could you please describe in detail the issues you’re facing? For instance, are you having trouble connecting or is your connection unstable?\"\n",
       "- Solution Delivery Section: The agent should clearly and directly explain the problem and its solution. For example, \"Our analysis indicates that the issue is due to a local network disruption. Our technical team has been alerted and is actively working on restoring normal service. We expect the problem to be resolved within the next two hours, and I will ensure you receive timely updates via text.\"\n",

For example, \"I understand your issue requires further investigation. Let me open a support ticket for your case right away, and I will send you a confirmation email shortly.\"\n",
       "- Upsell (AIDA) Section: The agent did well in this section but could create more urgency by saying something like: \"Furthermore, we have a limited-time offer on our upgraded service package that includes bonus features and faster speeds.\"\n",
