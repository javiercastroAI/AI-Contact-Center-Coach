    "# AI Contact Center Coach V Dec 25\n",
    "\n",
    "## What this notebook does (end-to-end)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a research/education prototype that evaluates a contact-center call transcript for script adherence, resolution promises, and coaching feedback. It produces a scored, section-by-section report plus an AI-generated coaching summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Setup and dependencies\n",
    "- Loads environment variables (expects `OPENAI_API_KEY`).\n",
    "- Imports OpenAI client for GPT-4 coaching, `sentence_transformers` for semantic similarity, and standard libraries for parsing and scoring.\n",
    "- If the API key is missing, execution stops with an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Reference scripts and benchmarks\n",
    "- Defines a **golden script**: example agent utterances for each call section (Greeting, Issue Identification, Troubleshooting, Solution Delivery, Resolution/Ticketing, Upsell, Closing).\n",
    "- Defines **benchmark scores** (75th percentile targets) per section, plus overall and CSAT targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Input transcript\n",
    "- Uses a diarized transcript string (`Agent:` / `Customer:` lines) without explicit section markers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Heuristic segmentation\n",
    "- Segments the transcript into sections using keyword matching **only on agent lines**.\n",
    "- A `current_section` is set based on the latest matched agent line, and **all subsequent lines** are grouped into that section until another agent line switches it.\n",
    "- This produces a map from section name to its collected utterances (agent + customer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5) Resolution promise extraction and validation (simulated)\n",
    "- Extracts agent statements that look like **promises of action** (e.g., open a ticket, send an email, notify the customer).\n",
    "- Runs a **simulated validation** function that returns a status (e.g., validated or pending). In a real system, this would query actual ticketing/email systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6) Script adherence scoring per section\n",
    "- For each section, it compares **only the agent utterances in that section** to the golden script.\n",
    "- Uses the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` sentence transformer to compute cosine similarity.\n",
    "- Each golden sentence is matched to its **best** agent sentence; the section score is the **average** of those best-match similarities.\n",
    "- Special handling replaces `[agent name]` in golden sentences with a detected name from the agent\u2019s utterance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7) Overall adherence and detailed feedback\n",
    "- Computes a **weighted overall adherence score** from section scores.\n",
    "- Generates a detailed markdown report showing per-section adherence vs. benchmarks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8) GPT-4 coaching summary\n",
    "- Builds a prompt that includes:\n",
    "  - The full transcript,\n",
    "  - Section adherence scores,\n",
    "  - Golden script reference options,\n",
    "  - Resolution promise validation results,\n",
    "  - CSAT score.\n",
    "- Calls GPT-4 to produce a coaching summary with sentiment analysis, strengths, improvement areas, and suggested phrasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9) Output\n",
    "- Displays markdown outputs for:\n",
    "  - Per-section similarity comparisons,\n",
    "  - Resolution promise checks (highlighting unfulfilled items),\n",
    "  - Overall and section-wise feedback,\n",
    "  - GPT-4 coaching narrative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important notes\n",
    "- This is a **prototype** for research/education, not production.\n",
    "- Resolution validation is **mocked**; replace with real system integrations for operational use.\n",
    "- The segmentation is **heuristic** and may misclassify sections if the wording changes.\n"

       "\n",
       "**Customer Sentiment Analysis:**\n",
       "- Start: The customer started the call with a neutral sentiment, stating their issue directly: \"Hi. My connection has been dropping all morning.\"\n",
       "- Middle: The sentiment slightly dips towards frustration when the customer says, \"So it's a local outage?\" However, the agent manages to maintain a positive interaction.\n",
       "- End: The customer's sentiment seems to improve towards the end of the call, as indicated by their interest in the upsell offer and their polite farewell: \"Thank you\", \"Oh? Interesting\", \"You too. Bye.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "**What the Agent Did Well:**\n",
       "- The agent provided a friendly and professional greeting, which set a positive tone for the interaction.\n",
       "- The agent was proactive in identifying the customer's issue, and they took immediate steps to troubleshoot.\n",
       "- The agent successfully opened a support ticket for the customer's case and promised to send a confirmation email.\n",
       "- The agent was able to upsell the premium plan to the customer and provide them with detailed information.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Areas for Improvement:**\n",
       "- The agent didn't adhere closely to the golden script, especially in the \"Solution Delivery Section\" and the \"Issue Identification Section.\"\n",
       "- The agent made a promise to check the customer's modem light status, but there was no follow-up on this, leaving the promise status as unknown.\n",
       "- The agent could improve on setting clear expectations for the customer. For instance, the estimated resolution time was discussed, but it did not align with the golden script, which may have caused confusion.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n",
       "- Greeting Section: The agent's greeting was familiar but didn't adhere to the script. The agent could consider using: \"Hello, thank you for calling ConnectPlus. My name is [agent name]. How may I assist you today? Good morning, and welcome to ConnectPlus support...\"\n",
       "- Issue Identification Section: The agent should thoroughly understand the customer's problem by asking more detailed questions. For example, \"Could you please describe in detail the issues you\u2019re facing? For instance, are you having trouble connecting or is your connection unstable?\"\n",
       "- Solution Delivery Section: The agent should clearly and directly explain the problem and its solution. For example, \"Our analysis indicates that the issue is due to a local network disruption. Our technical team has been alerted and is actively working on restoring normal service. We expect the problem to be resolved within the next two hours, and I will ensure you receive timely updates via text.\"\n",
       "- Resolution (Ticket Creation) Section: The agent should ensure that the customer understands the next steps and what to expect. For example, \"I understand your issue requires further investigation. Let me open a support ticket for your case right away, and I will send you a confirmation email shortly.\"\n",
       "- Upsell (AIDA) Section: The agent did well in this section but could create more urgency by saying something like: \"Furthermore, we have a limited-time offer on our upgraded service package that includes bonus features and faster speeds.\"\n",
       "- Closing Section: The agent could improve the closing section by using a more formal closing, such as, \"I hope I have addressed all your concerns. Thank you for contacting ConnectPlus. We value your business and are committed to your satisfaction.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The agent should ensure that all operational actions (like opening a support ticket or sending a confirmation email) are logged and checked with the customer to close the loop on the conversation. This can be done through a system like CRM or a"
